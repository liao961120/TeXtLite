## Biography

I received a B.S. in Psychology from National Taiwan University and am now pursuing a Master's degree in Linguistics at the same school. My strong interest in human evolution (which includes genetic AND cultural evolution) had driven me to study a range of interesting subjects such as *Prehistory & Archaeology*, *Cultural Anthropology*, *Linguistics*, *Genetics*, *Ecology*, and *Evolution*. It has also given me an insight into the importance of learning and transmitting skills, knowledge, and experience to others in our society. If you want to know why I'm obsessed with human evolution, you can check out [The Secret of Our Success](https://secretofoursuccess.fas.harvard.edu), a book written by Joseph Henrich (if you read Chinese, you can also have a brief overview of this book in [this blog post](/2019/08/15/secretOfOurSuccess.html)).

Aside from my interest in human evolution, I'm also a big fan of programming. Currently, I use Python for most of my research work. In my spare time, I write web apps with JavaScript and Vue (and sometimes Python, for backend processing). R is the language that brought me to the world of programming. The main forces that drove me to learn R was [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org): I was fascinated by R's ability to create **beautiful things**. Before I learned R, I was an expert on FAILING to learn to program. I guess that's because the first language I encountered was C++, and it is an awful language for beginners --- its extremely steep learning curve crushes people's motivations to learn to program.
